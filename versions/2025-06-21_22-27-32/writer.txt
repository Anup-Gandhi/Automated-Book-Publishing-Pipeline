### CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

From his perch on the jagged coral ledge, Dick's gaze swept south.

Behind him, the relentless roar of the outer sea thundered against the barrier reef, sending plumes of spindrift dancing on the wind. Yet, before him, lay a different world. The lagoon of Karolin stretched out, an infinite canvas of serene blue, calm as a polished mirror, save for the glint of fishing gulls wheeling overhead. Ringed by forty miles of coral, this vast basin was a sea unto itself – a tumultuous expanse in a gale, a shimmering azure lake under a gentle breeze. And it was his, all of it. He, who had arrived only yesterday, felt its silent claim.

Down on the sun-drenched beach, the entire tribe bustled: women mending nets, children at play, youths tending the *paraka* patches. All were his, these people. His, too, were the sleek canoes resting on the sand, and the hollow, empty houses where the formidable war canoes had once sat on their rollers.

A shadow crossed his brow. His gaze shifted from the serene lagoon to the silent canoe houses, then abruptly, he turned his back on the calm, facing instead the relentless breakers of the outer beach, the northern sea. Out there, beyond the curving horizon, lay Palm Tree – an island whispered to be as beautiful as a dream, yet, in his mind, it teemed with devils.

A small form stirred nearby. Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net-maker, sat perched on the coral, eyes wide as he looked up at the towering stranger. Tari, barely a breath of life, understood little of the world, yet he grasped this much: the war had devoured the men of Karolin, leaving the women, the boys, the infants like himself, utterly defenceless, adrift without a leader.

Then, just yesterday, from the vast northern sea, a strange boat had appeared. And with it, Katafa, the girl lost years ago to a fishing storm. And with them, *him*. This new figure, the women whispered, had been sent by the gods themselves to be their chief, their ruler.

The notion of 'gods' meant little to Tari, nor did he care. All that mattered was this magnificent new presence, right here, now. Away from his mother's watchful ear, emboldened by the moment, he posed the question with the stark simplicity only a child could muster.

"Taori," little Tari piped up, "who are you?" (é kamina tai)

A silent question hung in the air: Could he truly answer? Would this small child understand the complex weave of his own strange tale?

"Tari," he might have begun, his thoughts forming the unheard words, "I come from a world far beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was even smaller than you, a mere wisp, I was left alone with an old sailor named Kearney. Our home was that island you call Marua – Palm Tree – the one fifty miles north, just beyond the horizon. We lived there, just the two of us. He taught me to fish, to spear fish, to survive. He even built me toys, little ships unlike any canoe you've ever seen. And then, Tari, one day, long ago, Katafa came. The girl who had been swept away from *here* in a storm. She lived with us until..."
