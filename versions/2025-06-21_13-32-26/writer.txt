**The Gates of Morning: Book One**

**Chapter I: The Canoe Builder**

Dick, perched on a sun-drenched coral ledge, surveyed the southern horizon.

Behind him, the relentless roar of the outer sea’s breakers echoed, sending plumes of sea spray dancing on the breeze. In stark contrast, before him lay the lagoon of Karolin – a vast, tranquil expanse, boundless and impossibly blue, where fishing gulls wheeled gracefully through the air.

Enclosed by its forty-mile coral embrace, this immense basin was a sea unto itself: a tempestuous domain under fierce gales, yet a tranquil, azure mirror in the gentle breath of the trade winds. And astonishingly, it was *his* – he, who had stepped onto these shores just the previous day.

The entire tribe – women, children, and youths alike – bustled along the sun-drenched beach: some mending nets for fishing, others engaged in lively games, still others tending to the paraka patches. All of them, unmistakably, were his people. The canoes pulled high onto the sand, along with the vacant shelters where mighty war canoes once lay on their rollers, also belonged to him.

A subtle frown creased Dick's brow as his gaze shifted from the serene lagoon to the empty canoe houses. He turned abruptly, presenting his back to the calm inner waters, to face instead the crashing breakers of the outer beach and the northern sea. Out there, past the shimmering horizon, lay the unseen island of Palm Tree – a place of enchanting beauty, yet, chillingly, a nest of pure malevolence.

Close by, perched on a piece of coral, sat little Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net-maker. He peered up at Dick. Tari, with his limited understanding of the world, nevertheless grasped the profound truth: the war had claimed all the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children, like himself, utterly defenseless, bereft of a leader.

Then, only yesterday, a peculiar boat had emerged from the northern sea, carrying not only Katafa – the girl presumed lost years ago, swept away while fishing – but also this imposing, unfamiliar man. He was, the women whispered, a gift from the gods, sent to be their new chief and protector.

The child had no notion of who these "gods" might be, nor did he truly care. Now, alone with this fascinating newcomer, safely out of his mother's watchful earshot, he posed his question with all the unvarnished simplicity of childhood.

"Taori," little Tari piped up, his voice clear and curious, "who are you?" (é kamina tai)

If Dick *had* been able to answer, if the child could have comprehended the bewildering words of the tale Dick *might* have spun: "Tari, I hail from a people utterly removed from anything you know. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was even smaller than you, Tari, I found myself stranded with an old sailor named Kearney on that very island you call Marua – Palm Tree – the one hidden fifty miles to the north, just beyond your sight. There, we carved out a life. I grew from a boy into a young man, and Kearney taught me the arts of fishing and spearfishing. He even fashioned toys for me, miniature ships quite unlike the canoes of your islands. Then, Tari, one day, long ago now, Katafa arrived – the very girl who was swept away from here in that terrible storm. She lived with us until..."
