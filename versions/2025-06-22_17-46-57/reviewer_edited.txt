Here's the chapter rewritten in a more descriptive and immersive style, aiming for a slightly more modern and sensory feel, while preserving the original meaning and structure:

## THE CANOE BUILDER

D
ick stood poised on a jagged ledge of coral, his gaze fixed on the vast expanse of ocean stretching endlessly to the South.

Behind him, the relentless fury of the outer sea thundered, colossal breakers crashing and dissolving into a fine mist of spindrift that scattered wildly on the wind. Yet, before him lay a contrasting vision of profound calm: the infinite, luminous blue of Karolin Lagoon, placid as an inland lake, its surface barely disturbed save for the lazy circles of fishing gulls.

This immense, forty-mile ring of coral, a sea contained, was his. Just yesterday he had arrived, yet already it felt like an inheritance. In heavy gales, it could be a treacherous ocean; under light breezes, it transformed into a tranquil, azure mirror. And the people – the women, children, and youths scattered along the sun-blazed beach, busy with nets, games, or the cultivation of *paraka* – they were his tribe. His, too, were the slim canoes resting on the sand, and the silent, hollow houses where war canoes once sat poised on their rollers.

But as his gaze drifted from the sunlit lagoon to the quiet emptiness of the canoe houses, a frown creased his brow. He turned his back abruptly on the gentle inner sea, facing instead the relentless roar of the northern breakers, the vast, churning expanse of the outer ocean. Somewhere out there, beyond the visible horizon, lay Palm Tree—an island whispered to be as beautiful as a dream, yet, to Dick, swarming with unseen devils.

Close by, perched on the rough coral, little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net-maker, watched him with wide, curious eyes. Tari knew precious little of the world, yet he grasped one stark truth: the men of Karolin had been devoured by war, leaving the women, boys, and children—himself included—defenseless, adrift without a leader.

Then, only yesterday, a peculiar boat had sailed in from that very northern sea. And within it came not only Katafa, the girl long lost, swept away by a storm years ago while fishing, but also *this* new, formidable stranger. Sent by the gods, the women murmured, to be their chief, their protector.

The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. Alone now with this compelling new presence, beyond the prying ears of his mother, he seized his chance. With the unvarnished simplicity of childhood, he posed the question directly.

“Taori,” little Tari piped up, “who are you?” (*É kamina tai*.)

If Dick could have truly answered, would the child have understood the strange, labyrinthine tale that lived within him? “Tari,” he might have begun, “I come from a people beyond the very edges of your known world. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller even than you, Tari, I was marooned with an old sailor, Kearney, on that island you call Marua—Palm Tree—which lies fifty miles north, just beyond your sight. There we lived, and there I grew to a boy. Kearney taught me to fish, to spear fish, and he crafted things for me to play with, small ships utterly unlike the canoes of these islands. And then, Tari, one distant day, Katafa came. The girl blown away from here by a storm. She lived with us until…”
